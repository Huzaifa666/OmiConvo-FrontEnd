            Customer Accounts. Upon Customer’s request, OmiConvo will issue one
            or more administrator accounts (the “Administrator Accounts”) to
            Customer that provides Customer with the capability to create
            accounts for use by individuals who are an employee or contractor of
            Customer and that Customer wishes to have access to and use of the
            OmiConvo Platform (each, an “Administrative User”). Customers will
            ensure that Administrative Users only use the OmiConvo Platform
            through their Customer Account. Customers will not share the
            Administrator Accounts with any other person and will not allow
            Administrative Users to share their Customer Account with any other
            person. Customers will promptly notify OmiConvo of any actual or
            suspected unauthorized use of the OmiConvo Platform. OmiConvo
            reserves the right to suspend, deactivate, or replace any Customer
            Account or Administrator Accounts if it determines that the Customer
            Account or Administrator Account, as applicable, may have been used
            for an unauthorized purpose.

            period of time, at the then-current subscription rate described on
